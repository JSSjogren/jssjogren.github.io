            <h2>What I worked on...</h2>
              <p>Throughout NMIX 4310 we learnd how to develop iOS apps from the ground up.</p>
              <p>This was something that I had previously tinkered with, though not on a scale</p>
              <p>even remotely close to what we did here. This class really allowed me to flex</p>
              <p>and develop my design "muscles." Unlike the programs created in my computer science</p>
              <p>degree, we are able to really <i>see</i> the result of our code.</p>
              
              <br>
              
              <p>Though I completed the same assigned projects as the rest of the class for the</p>
              <p>majority of the semester, I really wanted to push myself for the final project.</p>
              <p>So, I developed something that I am passionate about: a videogame.</p>
              <p>I created a mobile game which I just called <b>Warp</b>. Warp was a galaga-like</p>
              <p>space shooter game. It allowed for different difficulties, multiple ship designs,</p>
              <p>and kept track of high scores for the users. This was one of the most ambitious</p>
              <p>projects that I had made to that date.</p>

            <h2>What I learned...</h2>
              <p>I think one of my biggest takeaways from this class was a small, but still noticable,</p>
              <p>increase in my design capabilities. Up until this point, I had not had the platform to</p>
              <p>really test out making my "applications" look nice. Most of them had just been command line</p>
              <p>applications. This class also allowed me to work with outside API's, which really helped</p>
              <p>broaden my horizons in terms of what I was able to create.</p>
