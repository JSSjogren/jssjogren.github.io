            <h2>What I worked on...</h2>
            <p>My team and I worked for Dan Smigrod at the We Get Around Network, a collection of people interested</p>
            <p>in 3D modeling of interior spaces such as homes, cruise ships, etc. In collaboration with Dan,</p>
            <p>we created an AR experience for his network which allowed these users to display their 3D models on</p>
            <p>their business cards for potential clients.</p>
            
            <br/>
            
            <p>I developed this app using Unity 3D and the Vuforia Image Target recognition API. These two platforms</p>
            <p>allowed me to develop an iOS app, which was submitted to the iOS App Store. To learn more about our</p>
              <p>project you can visit our project webpage at <a target="_blank" href="http://wegetaround.mynmi.net">wegetaround.mynmi.net</a></p>

            <h2>What I learned...</h2>
            <p>I think one of my biggest takeaways from this class was the ability to work with a </p>
            <p>team of diverse people. As a Computer Science major, I've always worked in groups</p>
            <p>where <i>everyone</i> is a developer. This was the first time I was granted the opportunity</p>
            <p>to work with people who had backgrounds in PR, film, design, and so much more. It was a </p>
            <p>very humbling experience to say the least. On top of that, it was really cool to see a project</p>
            <p>through from start to finish, from alpha to App Store... I've never been able to do something</p>
            <p>similar to this, and it's been incredible to do so.</p>
            <br/>
            
              <p>As I go into the job market I know that this will have a lasting impact on how I perceive</p>
              <p>people working in other departments. It will definitely grant me the ability to better</p>
              <p>communicate with and understand those who don't necessarily have the same background as me.</p>
